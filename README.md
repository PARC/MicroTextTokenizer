MicroText Tokenizer
========================

Micro-text refers to messages found in microblogging platforms like Twitter or
communications through SMS or similar messaging platforms. Micro-text has
several characteristics that make it different from text found in more
traditional documents. Standard NLP tools perform poorly on text like the
following:

```
 Cake?@Username K gotta get the hair,eyebrows n nails
done today b4 9 then I WISH I had sum one I could go
CAKE wit :( sigh
```

This example demonstrates several of the challenges in tokenization of
micro-text.

The MicroText Tokenizer is a Java tokenization library that can be used by NLP
systems that operate on Twitter, SMS, Slack, and other platforms where the
ongoing conversations demonstrate these phenomena.
